This project was created by [Maciej Glowacki](https://github.com/MaciejGL), [Stian Klasbu](https://github.com/mountwebs), and [Barbara Zujewska](https://github.com/b-zuj). The goal of the app is to make it easier for pysiotherapists to provide their services to clients in a digital world.

#### What is PhysIO
PhysIO was our final project at School of Applied Technology - we used 2 weeks to create an MVP that attempts to solve covid-related issue. We chose to focus on the limited access to health care where due to lockdowns and physical contact restrictions many less urgent health issues are beeing overlooked. This is a big problem in physiotherapy where caretakers often send a list of exercises to their patiens with at best a confusing ilustration and a short description. Many patients have trobule following those instructions and as a result their healt suffers. This is why we decide to create PhysIO which allows physiotherapists to send their patients more customized workout plans with informative videos. 

At current state the app provides only the basic functionality, but starting in January 2021 we are planning keep implementing additional features such as:
- expanding workout session/exercise customization and add session scheduling;
- add messaging functionality;
- implement remainders and notifications for clients.
